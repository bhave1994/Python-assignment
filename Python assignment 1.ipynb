    "\n",
    "The purpose is to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming and\n",
    "the main concept of OOPS is to find the data and function in a such way that can work together as a single unit so that no other\n",
    "data can access this data\n",

    "#2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Inheritence looks for a attribute first in the instance created for the class and then it searches in class followed \n",
    "by a superclass progressing from left to right (bydefault)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "A class is a type of blueprint that you can use to make object,template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of \n",
    "values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior while a instance object is used to call a class,the term \n",
    "'instance' refers to an object's relationship to its class and an object is a member or an \"instance\" of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "The First argument of a class including init is always a reference to the current class,this argument is always named as self\n",
    " \n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Init method,self refers to the newly created object\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "We call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Classes are declared by the keyword class followed by the class name\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created.\n",
